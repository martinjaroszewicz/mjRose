##mjRose

A mathematical rose curve.16
motion for HOA or WFS. Given that this external outputs (x,y,z) coordinates, it is suitable for working with a spherical system but can be used with a planar system with Z = 0. the mathematical rose curve is best know by its polar equation:
r = asin(nθ), or
r = acos(nθ).
- If n is odd, the rose is n-petalled. If n is even, the rose is 2n-petalled.
